This article covers various javascript array methods. Below is a summary of the key points from what i have read and understood on Array methods

## 1 . ARRAY METHODS
# Array Length:
Think of an array like a list. The length tells you how many things are in the list.
# Array toString():
This turns the list into a sentence, seperated by commas Instead of saying "apple", "banana", "orange",it makes it look like apple, banana ,orange.
# Popping and Pushing:
Popping is like taking the last thing out of a bag while Pushing is putting a new thing into the bag. the pop() method removes the last item on the list while the  push () method adds a new item on the list
# Shifting Elements:
Shifting is like moving the first thing in the list to the second position. Unshifting is putting something at the beginning of the list.
# Changing Elements:
If you want to rename something in your list, you just say what the new name is.
# Array delete():
Deleting is like crossing something off your list, but sometimes it leaves a gap. It's better to just remove the last or first thing using pop() or shift() instead.
# Merging Arrays (concat()):
cancatenating is like combining two lists to make a big list. it doesn't change the original lists but just comes up with a new list of combined items
# Flattening an Array (flat()):
If your list has sub lists inside it, this makes it a simple list. Like if your list is "apple, [banana, orange], mango," it turns it into "apple, banana, orange, mango."
# Splicing and Slicing Arrays:
Splicing is like adding or removing things from the middle of your list.
Slicing is taking a part off your list and making a new list with just that part.
# Sorting Arrays:
Putting your list in order, like arranging books on a shelf.

## Javascript functions.
# What is a Function?
*  A JavaScript function is like a set of instructions designed to do a specific task.
* It runs when something triggers it (calls it).
# Function Structure:
* Functions start with the keyword function, followed by a name and parentheses.
* The parentheses can contain parameters (input values) separated by commas.
* The actual code to be executed is enclosed in curly brackets.
# Function Parameters and Arguments:
* Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
* Arguments are the values passed into the function when it's called.
* Inside the function, arguments behave like local variables.
# Function Invocation:
* Functions can be triggered in various ways, such as when a button is clicked or when called from JavaScript code.
# Function Return:
* When a function encounters a return statement, it stops executing, and the result is sent back to the caller.
* Functions often calculate and return values.
# Why Use Functions?
* Functions allow you to write reusable code that can be used multiple times.
* You can use the same code with different inputs to get different results.
# The () Operator:
* The parentheses () are used to invoke (call) a function and pass arguments.
# Functions with Incorrect Parameters:
* Providing incorrect parameters might lead to incorrect results.
# Functions Used as Variable Values:
* Functions can be used directly in calculations or assignments, eliminating the need for a separate variable.
# Local Variables:
* Variables declared within a function are local to that function.
* They can only be accessed within the function.
* Local variables are created when the function starts and deleted when it ends.
