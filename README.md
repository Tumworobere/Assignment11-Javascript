This article covers various javascript array methods. Below is a summary of the key points from what i have read and understood on Array methods

## 1 . ARRAY METHODS
# Array Length:
Think of an array like a list. The length tells you how many things are in the list.
# Array toString():
This turns the list into a sentence, seperated by commas Instead of saying "apple", "banana", "orange",it makes it look like apple, banana ,orange.
# Popping and Pushing:
Popping is like taking the last thing out of a bag while Pushing is putting a new thing into the bag. the pop() method removes the last item on the list while the  push () method adds a new item on the list
# Shifting Elements:
Shifting is like moving the first thing in the list to the second position. Unshifting is putting something at the beginning of the list.
# Changing Elements:
If you want to rename something in your list, you just say what the new name is.
# Array delete():
Deleting is like crossing something off your list, but sometimes it leaves a gap. It's better to just remove the last or first thing using pop() or shift() instead.
# Merging Arrays (concat()):
cancatenating is like combining two lists to make a big list. it doesn't change the original lists but just comes up with a new list of combined items
# Flattening an Array (flat()):
If your list has sub lists inside it, this makes it a simple list. Like if your list is "apple, [banana, orange], mango," it turns it into "apple, banana, orange, mango."
# Splicing and Slicing Arrays:
Splicing is like adding or removing things from the middle of your list.
Slicing is taking a part off your list and making a new list with just that part.
# Sorting Arrays:
Putting your list in order, like arranging books on a shelf.
